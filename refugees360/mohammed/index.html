                <p>When the war started, Mohammad was studying law as a university student. After graduating, he wanted to study more, but the army recruited him to fight. He didn’t even bring a jacket with him when he left in July, 2015. 
                </p>
                <p>Mohammad says he spent around 3000 euros getting to Germany. He took a boat from Turkey to Greece, departing at night. After just an hour at sea, he says, someone from the Turkish police came and threatened to send the boat back. 
                </p>
                <p>Mohammad had bought a personal flotation device before he left Turkey. He jumped from the boat and spent three hours in the sea before arriving alone on a beach somewhere in Greece. He spent two hours walking before finding refuge in an abandoned church. He was eventually sent to a refugee camp. From there, he traveled to Athens and then continued along the Balkan route to Germany. He still thinks about what happened to the other passengers in his boat. 
                </p>
                <p>Mohammed used his mobile phone to help him navigate the way, crossing borders at night. He traveled from Macedonia to Serbia and Serbia to Hungary, where he says he was forced to stay for fifteen days in a prison. 
                </p>
                <p>
                He arrived to Germany in late summer and spent the first few days not knowing what to do or where to go. He was one of the many people stuck in line at LaGeso, the German social services department in Berlin. According to Mohammad, The German immigration department told him they sent him his paperwork on October 10, 2015. However, he says he didn’t receive anything until March 15, 2016.

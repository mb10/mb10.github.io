                <p>Khaled arrived to Germany in January 2015. Like around 800 thousand others that year, he made the journey from Turkey to Greece via boat. For Khaled, crossing the sea from Turkey to Greece took four tries. Even before his attempts to cross by sea he nearly made it onto a plane posing as an Italian man. He was asked to speak Italian to a fellow Syrian man with fake Italian papers and both their covers were blown. 
                </p>
                <p>He now stays in refugee housing in Muenster. He had to wait for nearly seven months for his paperwork to allow him to attend German language courses. He’s been looking for a new flat for nearly eight months. He says most people do not want to rent a flat to him because they believe he is living off the government’s money. He is also in search of work but he hopes to go back to Syria as soon as the war is over so he can rebuild his country.

                <p>Kholoud worked in Turkey for nearly a year in order to save money for the trip to Germany for her and her family. While working in Turkey, Kholoud says she was imprisoned for an unclear reason. Forced to stay in a prison in Turkey for over a month without a trial or a lawyer, she was eventually sent to a city far away from Istanbul. 
                </p>
                <p>After saving enough money she and her family traveled traveled to Turkey to cross the sea to Greece. They had to wait for several days in the cold for the sea to be calm enough to cross. On their first attempt to cross, the overcrowded boat began to sink and everyone threw their bags overboard. Kholoud lost all her papers, including her passport. 
                </p>
                <p>On the second try, they made it to Greece. Kholoud says the Red Cross assisted them from Macedonia to Serbia and then through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany. Her family continued on to Sweden, but she wanted to stay with her husband, Khaled.
